## Reflection

### Design Choices

    I chose these frameworks because they are similar to what we had done for homeworks during the semester so it is what I am used to.
    React makes decent sense to me in terms of structure, express is very easy to use, and my schema is just based on what I think works best.

### Challenges

    The hardest part was designing the game flow, it took me a while mainly due to learning how to combine the game logic into js and HTML.

### Learning Outcomes

    I learned that I now know how to make an authentication and live updates with react. I also learned that deployment is much easier than I originally thought, 
    but required a good bit of code adjustment.

### Future Work

    I would further refine the aesthetic and also add more options for the simulator itself, such as doubling down.
